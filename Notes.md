Coding notes:
-when coding moves... for pawns, check if has moved is true; if not true and a jump move, set epvalid true... if has moved true, and epvalid true (from last turn), set epValid false

-WORKING ON UPDATE METHOD SO checks can be evaluated on a copied board. updating jumps, en passant, and castling needs attention

- Checkmate: check king movement, check blocking, check taking check piece


TODO:
-checkmate!!!

Checkmate logic can take - create new board and check...
